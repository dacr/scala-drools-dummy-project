A scala drools project skeleton, SBT based, with some SBT plugins enabled (eclipse and assembly). Everything needed to test drools expert system, using scala language and eclipse as an optional IDE.

$ sbt
> eclipse
> exit

$ sbt run

So, Eclipse is optional, but if used all features are available for the scala language, if and only if you have installed scala eclipse plugin (http://www.scala-ide.org/).
